            <h2>The Multiverse</h2>
            <p>The Multiverse is an infinite expanse of planes, each a unique and vibrant world with its own cultures, magic, and challenges. At the center of Magic: The Gathering is the ability of planeswalkers to traverse these worlds, creating endless possibilities for conflict, alliances, and discovery.</p>

        <!-- Featured Plane: Mirrodin -->
        <section>
            <h2>Mirrodin: A World of Metal</h2>
            <p>Mirrodin, originally known as Argentum, is a plane where every aspect of the environment is made of metal. Created by the planeswalker Karn, this artificial world is a place of beauty and danger. Its five suns cast their light over landscapes of razor-sharp grass, metallic mountains, and rivers of quicksilver.</p>
            <p>Mirrodinâ€™s inhabitants include both native lifeforms and species transplanted from other planes. Among them are the resilient Vulshok, the crafty Vedalken, the ferocious Leonin, and the mysterious Neurok. Each group has adapted to the metallic environment, creating a rich and diverse culture.</p>
            <p>Mirrodin's story takes a dark turn with the emergence of the Phyrexians. Their invasion corrupts the plane, transforming it into New Phyrexia. The once beautiful world becomes a nightmarish landscape of biomechanical horrors, and the struggle for survival continues under the shadow of Phyrexian domination.</p>
